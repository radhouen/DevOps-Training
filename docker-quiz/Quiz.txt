1- Applications inside the containers accept configuration parameters in the form of environment variables. These variables can tell the app to listen on a specific port but you can't use a specific password.*

    A- True
    B- False

2- You can't create multiple containers from the same image*

    A- True
    - False

3- A Docker container is an instance of an image with a specific configuration.*

    A- False
    B- True

4- Why do you need to write a Dockerfile?*

    A- You want to access and use Docker Hub
    B- You want to publish your application to Docker Hub
    C- Because you'd like your application to remain in a private space

5- Volume mapping maps the host server's directory into the Docker container. The data will remain in a safe and accessible place if you do which of the following?*

    A- re-create the container
    B- delete the container
    C- break the container
    D- migrate the container
    E- backup the container

6- Which is not true about Docker Hub?*

    A-The Hub is a network service
    B- It gives access to Docker images
    C- Docker Hub is a network storage
    D- It's a totally private repository

7- A Docker image provides a template for a container with all the necessary files of an application, but has no instructions to run it.*

    A- True
    B- False

8- Docker containers and images are included in Plesk Backup and migrated by Plesk Migrator.*

    True
    False

9- If the Plesk server can't run Docker locally, you can still connect to a remote Docker server to manage containers. You'll need:*

    A- One separate ready-to-code environment
    B- A Windows Server
    C- The Plesk Docker extension
    D- A virtuozzo 6 container

10- Choose the system requirements you need to run Docker on a Plesk Onyx Server:*

    A- 20GB of free disk space
    B- A compatible Linux OS
    C- At least 2GB of RAM
    D- One physical server
    E- A 64-bit CPU

11- Why wouldn't you see Docker in Plesk installer's list of components?*

    A- The server does not satisfy Docker system requirements
    B- Your Plesk license doesn't have a Docker add-on
    C- Docker is available as an extension and you can only install it from the extensions catalog

12- How can you make sure your Docker containers and their data are safely backed up?*

    A- Set up volume mapping on all containers to store their data in a single location on the server (example, /data/) and backup this location.
    B- Schedule regular Plesk backups. Docker containers are included in Plesk backups.
    C- Backup the /var/lib/docker/ directory manually
    D- Nothing. Data stored in Docker containers is backed up to Docker Hub.

13- Which of these flowing is not a docker instruction:

	A- RUN
	B- APT-GET
	C- USER

14- RUN <command>  is run in a shell, which by default is /bin/sh -c on Linux :

	A- True
	B- False

15- Write the command to :

	A- Stop all containers :
	B- Remove all containers:
	C- Remove all Docker images:

16- What is the difference between the COPY and ADD commands in a Dockerfile?

17- What is Docker container?

18-  Is there a way to identify the status of a Docker container?

19- What is the difference between Docker Image and Layer?

20- Can you run Docker containers natively on Windows?

	A- True
	B- False

21- How does Docker run containers in non-Linux systems?

22- Can you explain dockerfile ONBUILD instruction?

23- Give some best practices to create a docker container ?

24- What is the name of the container runtime used by Docker? (hint: it is from Open Container Initiative)

25- What happens when you execute this on the commandline?  docker run debian /bin/sh

	A. A prompt from the shell of created container will be thrown to you
	B. A container is created and then exited immediately
	C. A container is created and executes in the detached mode; you can attach to it later using the container id
	D. Docker CLI issues the error: Error response from daemon: No command specified.

26-What happens when you execute this on the commandline with -p option?
	$ docker run -p 80-87:80 --name nginx3 -d nginx

	A. The port 80 in the container is mapped to ports 80 and 87 in the host machine
	B. The port 80 in the hostmachine is mapped to ports 80 and 87 in the container
	C. The port 80 in the container is mapped to a port in the range 80 to 87 in the host machine
	D. Docker CLI will issue the error: “Invalid syntax: Using hyphen is not allowed with -P command”

27- Which command do you use “to find layers and their sizes” in an image using Docker CLI?

	A. Use “docker images -layers <<imageid>>” command
	B. Use “docker layers <<imageid>> command
	C. Use “docker history <<imageid>> command
	D. There is no way you can find layers and their sizes using Docker CLI - you need to use external tools

28- Which command do you use “recreate the Dockerfile that was used to build that image” from a given image id/tag using Docker CLI?

	A. Use “docker images -dockerfile <<imageid>>” command
	B. Use “docker build -reverse <<imageid>> command
	C. Use “docker history --no-trunc --out:<filename> <<imageid>> command
	D. There is no way to recreate the Dockerfile that was used to build that image from a given image id/tag using Docker CLI


29- You are creating a new container with this command:

docker run -d --name myubuntu ubuntu /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo current date and time is: $(date); sleep 10; done”

Which network is the “myubuntu” container attached to?

	A. Bridge network
	B. Overlay network
	C. Custom network
	D. Host network
	E. None (not connected to any network)

30- Which one of the following is a recommended Docker BEST PRACTICE?

	A. Prefer using docker commit or docker import instead of using docker build using Dockerfiles (for creating custom/new images)
	B. Use --link for linking containers explicitly on the same host instead of using default bridge network for inter container communication (ICC)
	C. Put ADD commands later in the Dockerfile because the source files or executables may change but the earlier layers will not change (to avoid “cache bursting”)
	D. Use explicit file/dir paths (e.g., -v /usr/mydir:/usr/mydir) instead of using named volumes created using “docker volume create” command

31- When you run this command, what will be the PID of /bin/sh?

	"docker run -it alpine /bin/sh"

	A. PID 1
	B. Same as the PID of the docker process in the host
	C. PID 0
	D. Don’t know ;) Its randomly assigned by Docker
